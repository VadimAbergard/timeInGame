# timeInGame
save your played time in game!

Sometimes I want to know how much time I spent in the game?

So I created a program that solves this issue!

steps:
1) download https://disk.yandex.ru/d/Z2tu3BvdkA2KVQ
2) drag and drop all files from the zip file to the executable file with the game
3) change the start.bat file, fill in the text instead of parentheses

how does it work?

when the timeInGame program is open, every 30 seconds write file spent time in game, hours.minutes.seconds
